       I'm a recent Computer Science graduate and an incoming Junior Software Developer at Capgemini. 
       I have a strong foundation in programming and machine learning, with hands-on experience from a NASA 
       internship focused on ML/AI and a fellowship at Cornell Tech through Break Through Tech AI. I'm proficient 
       in Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript, and my interests lie in machine learning, data science, and 
       artificial intelligence. I'm always eager to learn new skills and explore the diverse opportunities within 
       computer science.
